# Web-Scraping
1- Trading View: In this project, I scrape data from tradingview.com about two markets: firstÂ stocks and second cryptocurrency . Stocks, also known as equities, are ownership shares that entitle the bearer to a portion of a company's assets and earnings, and how they are traded on the stock market. Second, there is a cryptocurrency market. I collect data on leading cryptocurrencies and their performance, as well as the current price for each one in US dollars and other important information.
