# Web-Scraping
1- Trading View: In this project, I scrape data from tradingview.com about two markets: first stocks and second cryptocurrency . Stocks, also known as equities, are ownership shares that entitle the bearer to a portion of a company's assets and earnings, and how they are traded on the stock market. Second, there is a cryptocurrency market. I collect data on leading cryptocurrencies and their performance, as well as the current price for each one in US dollars and other important information.

2- Top Companies: For this project, I collected data from companiesmarketcap.com on the top 100 companies in the world based on metrics such as market cap, earnings, revenue, employees, market cap gain, market cap loss, total assets, net assets, total debt, cash on hand, and other metrics, as well as the rank for each company in each category.

3- Forbes: In this project, I collected data from Forbes.com on the top richest people in the world and divided it into three parts: one for billionaires and their net worth and the main field for this worth and their countries, one for richest women in the United States and their net worth and the main field for this worth and their location in each state in the United States, and one for richest people in China and similar information to that of the United States.
